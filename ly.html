INTRO
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

VERSE 1

Needless to say, I keep her in check
She was a bad bad, nevertheless

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Needless to say, I'm keepin' her in check
She was a bad bad, nevertheless

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt

Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
PRE-CHORUS
Ooh, some things you just can't refuse

*Let me take you on a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

CHORUS

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya

You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

VERSE 2

Every time I'm leavin' on ya
You don't make it easy, no
Wish I could be there for ya
Give me a reason to go
Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now

BRIDGE

I know you're scared of the unknown (known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (go)
But it's out of my control

CHORUS

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower

I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya

You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
